## Research Interests

My research focuses on healthcare data analysis & data privacy, primarily addressing missing data imputation in distributed networks. I also apply statistical modeling for clinical research and clinical prediction models using EHR data. Additionally, I develop privacy-enhancing technologies for healthcare, bioinformatics, and financial applications.

## Missing Data Imputation in Distributed Healthcare Networks

Our mission is to address the challenge of missing data imputation in distributed clinical networks. We develop imputation algorithms that enable healthcare institutions to collaboratively handle missing data without directly sharing sensitive patient information. These approaches allow improving data quality in distributed clinical networks for downstream statistical analyses and predictive tasks.

## Statistical Analysis for Clinical Research & Evidence-Based Studies

I also collaborate with several anesthesiologists, developing statistical models and analyses to support their clinical research on topics such as patients' respiratory function during surgery. Currently, I'm also interested in real-world evidence analyses on publicly available datasets, e.g., MIMIC.

## EHR Data and Clinical Prediction Model

I am also currently working on research related to Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Clinical Prediction Models (CPM).

## Federated Learning & Data Privacy in Finance and Bioinformatics

We propose a federated XGBoost model for financial crime prediction as the 1st prize solution in US PETs Challenge. We also design solutions for data generation of SNPs data for GWAS studies for privacy preservation.
