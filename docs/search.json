    "text": "Hi there! I am a Ph.D. candidate at Rutgers Business School, working under the supervision of Dr. Jaideep Vaidya at the Rutgers Institute of Data Science Learning and Application (Rutgers iDSLA). I hold a Master’s in Computer Science from USC and Bachelor’s in Physics from Zhejiang University, China.\nMy research focuses on healthcare data science, particularly missing data imputation (e.g., in distributed healthcare networks), clinical and EHR data analysis (e.g., real-world evidence (RWE)), federated learning and Synthetic Data Generation. I am passionate about developing statistical and data science methods to advance evidence-based healthcare analysis."
