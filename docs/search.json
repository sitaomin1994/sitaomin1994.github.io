    "text": "Research Directions\n\n\nMy research intersection of data management, AI/ML, and healthcare data science. I proposed serveral data quality improvement algorithms (missing data) for distributed healthcare networks. I also applied generative and preditive AI for statistical modeling for EHR and genomic data. Additionally, I develop privacy-enhancing technologies for healthcare, bioinformatics, and financial applications.\n\n\n\nResearch Projects & Publications\n\n\nStream1: Missing Data Imputation in Distributed Healthcare Networks\n\nOur mission is to address the challenge of missing data imputation in distributed clinical networks. We develop imputation algorithms that enable healthcare institutions to collaboratively handle missing data without directly sharing sensitive patient information. These approaches allow improving data quality in distributed clinical networks for downstream analyses and AI models. We developed a toolkit for distributed missing data imputation called FedImpute.\n\n\n\nMin, S., et al. Cafe: Improved Federated Data Imputation by Leveraging Missing Data Heterogeneity.

We also collaborate with anesthesiologists, developing statistical models to support their clinical research. Currently, I’m also interested in real-world evidence analyses on publicly available datasets, e.g., MIMIC. We are developing tools to collect, process, analyze and benchmark public medical datasets called MedDataKit and we are benchmarking ML/DL based clinical prediction models combined with multimodal information for perioperative surgical data for postoperative complications prediction.\n\n\n\nWang, X., Min, S., & Vaidya, J.
