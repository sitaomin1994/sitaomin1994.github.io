Hi there! I am a Ph.D. candidate at Rutgers University, under the supervision of [Dr. Jaideep Vaidya](https://sites.rutgers.edu/jsvaidya/){target="_blank"} at the Rutgers Institute of Data Science Learning and Application ([Rutgers iDSLA](https://sites.rutgers.edu/idsla/){target="_blank"}). I hold a Master's in Computer Science from USC and a Bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University, China.

My research focuses on healthcare data science, particularly **missing data imputation** (e.g., in distributed healthcare networks), **clinical and EHR data analysis** (e.g., real-world evidence (RWE)), **federated learning**, and **data privacy**. I am passionate about developing statistical and data science methods for healthcare data analysis.
